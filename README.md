### Removal of old JavaScript

This fork uses downsized/simplified versions of scripts and has no support for Internet Explorer.

The result is faster and smaller download code (good for mobile networks).

Things might work in Edge 18, Firefox 50-62 and Chrome 54-68 due to one polyfill for array.flat().

* Replaced bootstrap.js with native drop-in replacement
* Replaced dev/Common/ClientStorageDriver/* with Web Storage Objects polyfill

### Squire vs CKEditor
The [Squire](https://github.com/neilj/Squire) implementation is not 100% compatible yet, but it shows the massive overhead of CKEditor.

Still TODO:

* support for tables (really needed?!?)
* support BIDI (really needed?!?)

|       	| normal	| min    	| gzip  	| min gzip	|
|--------	|-------:	|-------:	|------:	|--------:	|
|squire  	| 128.826	|  47.074	| 33.671	|   15.596	|
|ckeditor	|       ?	| 520.035	|      ?	|  155.916	|

CKEditor including the 7 asset requests (css,language,plugins,icons) is 633.46 KB / 180.47 KB (gzip).

To use the old CKEditor, you must install the plugin.
